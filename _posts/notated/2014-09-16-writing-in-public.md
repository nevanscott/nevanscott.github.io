  Who will bring back some of the open dialog that was part and parcel to the kind of web that I recall fondly?

I've been reading more and more musings about the possibly lost "old" web, mostly from people I admire such as Mandy, Jason, and Erin. Young as they are, I feel as they are the generation before me in terms of web time, so when they sputter about what's going on, for some reason it affects me.

The good news is that there's also seemed to be a bit of a resurgence of folks attempting to blog more again, to bring back some of the open dialog that was part and parcel to the kind of web that I recall fondly.

I may still continue to try again, but certainly don't promise anything at all. I do find it amusing that I'm typing these words on an iPad, using the Wordpress app. After all these long years, it does warm my heart a bit that there is this thriving and striving platform at my fingertips, free and wild, but willing to meet me whenever the technology of the day has taken me. This looks nothing like my first version of Wordpress, not by a long shot.

But still, it comforts.
