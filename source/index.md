  <strong>Hi there!</strong> I teach user&nbsp;experience and interaction&nbsp;design in&nbsp;Barcelona.

<div class="rotator" markdown="1">

- I'm learning how to say "design&nbsp;educator" without&nbsp;wincing.
- I have a pretty liberal definition of *puppet*, *teaching*, and&nbsp;*definition*.
- I prioritize people over&nbsp;tools.
- My home is not "smart" and I'd like to keep&nbsp;it that&nbsp;way.

</div>

<script>
(function() {
  const $rotator = document.querySelector('.rotator');
  const $list = $rotator.querySelector('ul');

  $rotator.classList.add('enabled');
  $list.firstElementChild.classList.add('active');

  $list.addEventListener('click', function() {
    const $current = $list.querySelector('.active');
    const $next = $current.nextElementSibling || $list.firstElementChild;

    $current.classList.remove('active');
    $next.classList.add('active');
  });
})();

Teaching
--------

I've [always wanted to teach](/teaching/), and am always delighted to find people who want to learn something with me. Currently I teach a [UX/UI design bootcamp](https://uxui.cat) at Ironhack in Barcelona.

In the past, I've taught [at Noble Desktop](/noble/) and [at General Assembly](/ga/), both in New York.


Writing
-------

I write and share thoughts on what I'm reading around the web at [notated.org](http://notated.org).


Midnight Breakfast
------------------

[Midnight Breakfast](https://midnightbreakfast.com/) is a magazine I help publish alongside [Rebecca Rubenstein](https://rebeccarubenstein.com), [Taylor Pavlik](httpss://twitter.com/FTPavlik), [Lauren O'Neal](https://twitter.com/laureneoneal), [Ashley Perez](https://twitter.com/artscollide), and a [ton of wonderful](/midnightbreakfast/) [writers and artists](https://midnightbreakfast.com/contributors).


Design & Development
--------------------

I like to make websites, and have spent most of my career doing so. I learned to make websites as a hobby, and in college I found myself a position making websites for professors. I started out working for [an agency in L.A.](/la/), then moved to New York, where I worked on projects [as a freelancer](/freelance/) and as a partner [at Cantilever](/cantilever/). Eventually I made my way to Berlin, making websites with [Edenspiekermann](https://www.edenspiekermann.com).
